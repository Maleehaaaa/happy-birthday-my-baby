And that's the kind of person you're, ik you say you're not mature and find faults in yourself but i do not mean if because I'm maleeha but you're the one who's presence can just make the other person comforted 
and i remember ðŸ˜­rabeea ka ex told her i won't tell you i love you until i fully mean it                         <h2>
