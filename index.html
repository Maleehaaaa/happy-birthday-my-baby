<h3>To You!</h3>
<p>I would have send you a gift better than cheesecake this time but you would prolly hire a hitman , if i do that sksksk so i have to do yeh- par hrowbrh i wish i could give you more , eitherways it's YOUR BIRTHDAY ðŸ˜­ðŸ‘‹and i saw you age from 16 to 19 and it just makes me so happy that you were with me all this time , where do i even start?gosh i love you and i mean it with all my heart and uff where do i even start i don't think i can put everything in these words but I'll try to, the first time i saw you and i told you this before bohot dafa. </p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page2">
<p>you looked so strict and scary , at times i didn't know if you would laugh at my jokes because i thought ðŸ˜­what if he scolds me and when you did laugh i would breath a sense of relief like hehe , then i got to know your lil habits how much you love your lil babies ðŸ˜­i remember the day i asked you to send me your cat pics and you gave me a whole house tour showing all your cats and i giggled sm i was like kya insaan hein yehðŸ˜­ðŸ‘‹i don't i ever met someone who has ITNE CATS IN HIS SURROUNDINGS- and the way you sounded so excited showing me sab , and from the first moment i listened to your voice it made me fr like woah itni pyaari awaz hein iski and i dont think theres anyone whos voice is as calming soothing beautiful like yours even a galli sounds pyaari tumhari awaz mein.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page3">
<p>and time passed i would text you 8 hours ke baad at times and ðŸ˜­you would ask me about it and i genuinely thought you had alot of people in your life so i didn't think it mattered to you if i seenzoned you par deep down it made me happy- and i realised pehele your stories your memories i love how you perceive chize i wish i was in your brain LIKE A PARASITE to see them from your eyes and i realised idk how par i fell in love with this person and ðŸ˜­IG I HOLD THE RECORD OF BEING THE ONLY GIRL WHO RECEIVED " WISH YOU WERE MY SISTER " from a guyðŸ˜­and goshh i realised how larke felt when they are called bhai- and i remember i only told two people about it- and they were hiding their hasiðŸ˜­ðŸ‘‹</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page4">
<p>par i liked talking to you i didn't realise par i would be smiling, i would think yeh kya kar raha hoga , or thinking what should i say you aaj dkehtey dekhety pata hei nai chala and i never thought i could reach this level of happiness until i met you , i never knew life could be this colourful like i mean it i started noticing more colours and yk how woh song goes " berang sei hei zindagi" i never realised ZINDAGI MEIN RANG BHI HOTEY i sound stupid par even in my saddest time , you were there and that was enough, happy or sad times just you were there and i don't know what peace is supposed to feel like par if it is , i think it may feel alot like you. </p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page5">
<p>and ig it was just like you're there even in the saddest stuff i didn't realise i undermined your presence because you were there and that saddest moments felt bearable , even when i wasn't talking to you just texting or just when everything is crumbling i somehow come back to you even while watching your Instagram user line beside your pfp made it bearable  And that's the kind of person you're, ik you say you're not mature and find faults in yourself but i do not mean if because I'm maleeha but you're the one who's presence can just make the other person comforted and i remember ðŸ˜­rabeea ka ex told her i won't tell you i love you until i fully mean it And idk whyðŸ˜­ðŸ‘‹i was like rhkendhd i should prolly do the same and then JUST IDK 1 MONTH BAAD.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page6">
<p> i was talking about how our neighbour aunty is so cute and i wanna bake her something and you sended me recipesðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜­and MADE WAS THE FIRST TIME I WAS LIKE GOSH I LOVE HIM , this sounds very lame maybe tumhe par it wasðŸ˜­ a huge deal , it was a choti chiz par it was really sweet , it takes lil seconds to send recipes par the fact you even thought about it for me because it was something i wanted to do like mere liye ðŸ˜­parrr LIKE YOU MADE IT SOMETHG LIKE US WALI CHIZ IDK how to make it sound okay but it wasn't just meri chiz like it became your chiz too and somehow from that day what became yours was mine and mine yours, and i still remember the day you opened up to me, i think it was something that i would always find it specialðŸ˜­it's just i comforted you and that was the most nicest feeling.</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page7">
<p> obviously it made me sad because i realised i wish i could never let you experience yeh and seeing you hurt made me feel as well the frustrating part was i couldn't do anything but comforting you felt so special,the more i got to know i realised there were so many new stuff i learnt about you and every thing you did and your life everything the more i knew you the more i loved you, even your mistakes , i know you point out alot of chize and think you have alot of faults and you do and i do too that's how humans are they are supposed to have faults par even with your faults you're still the kindest and admirable person i do not mean it as maleeha par looking around everyone and the people i met , i realised there's no one like you andðŸ˜­ðŸ‘‹i mean it with your life incidents too. </p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page8">
<p>uff allah i wish i was in your brain or something ðŸ˜­ydk how much i laugh listening to your life storiesðŸ˜­and there's no one like you- even the parts where you used to get naked and run as supermanðŸ˜­ðŸ‘‹and you holding your pee until mama comesðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜­and when you used to held your breath under water and i love listening to your family stories and your each family member ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜­it's like sab different version of jawad hein- and OH HAAN WHEN U CRASHED YOUR CAR and you getting annoyed at hammad because he slept with mama i swear youre so adorable I FIND EVERYTHING U SAY AS A CAT LIKE CATS ARE ADORABLE PAR U LOOK EVEN MORE ADORABLE FLUFFY CREATURE</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page9">
<p>AND U ... throw up to eat more- like kya pagal insaan-ðŸ˜­and aww i used to scold you to brush like a kid it was disgusting yet i found it adorable to scold u to brush and then when you cry when i scold u even thora sa makes me laugh and sad and regret because i don't wanna make u sad par at the samw time yeh banda who could crush me in a sec and throw me up whos way taller than me ans has muscles- cries when i scold him- ilysm and I LOVE u even when you gained weight you're perfect ðŸ‘‹and YOU THOUGHT U WERE GAY ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­LIKE THERE SHOULD BE CORE JUST KNOWN AS JAWAD CORE You know jawad you're courageous, you know deep down you're scared too and you feel sad but even in your fear you still stand up and that's admirable , idk about faults but i don't think you realise how much it takes to be courageous even in the difficult positions even a 30 year old might not have itna courage to tell people what's right but you do, i wish i was like you more and you have the prettiest smile I've ever seen , like you know the leaves would be all withered and you would smile the leaves would grow back and flourish again that's how pretty your smile is</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page10">
<p>you make me feel so safe and you actually make everyone feel safe around you , even talking to feels like it's okayy everything is okay and it's not just me but it's for everyone i met when i ask them about you heck even rabeea says it how it feel safes around you because you're mature , understanding and your mere presence is comforting enough , and You're kind you're really and you're mature with pure heart , you try to not hurt other's and you care for every cat and even watching them in winter makes you feel sad , i just know allah tumsein hamesha khush rahengey and you feel like itna griwjeyie fragile i feel like i need to protect you it's just you have itni innocent si thinking and you care for lil stuff as to not hurt me</p>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page11">
<p>And you're so strong ðŸ˜­like one of the strongest person i know , even with stuff you handled it all alone , even with your struggles you managed to do everything you can and you tried and im so proud of you i don't i think im even a lil as strong as you and You're a good man and you take care of your family and i love genuinely how you take care of your sisters and hammadðŸ˜­and you don't admit par you're actually a very good brother and you try your best you don't see your efforts but i wish you could see yourself from my eyes youre a good son ,  and a brother and a good friend and good uhm uhm and you deserve way more happiness  i wish i could protect you from everything you have such lil habits that makes you feel like you're so i feel like words cannot describe you but how could you be so sweet </p>
